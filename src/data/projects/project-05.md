This fencing project gave the client's yard a major visual and functional boost. We removed the old, weathered fence and installed a clean, durable new privacy fence using high-quality wood. The result: enhanced curb appeal, increased security, and a more defined outdoor space.

ðŸªš Before:
The existing fence was weathered, aged, and sagging in multiple areas
Gaps in coverage reduced privacy and left the yard exposed
Uneven lines and outdated materials detracted from the homeâ€™s overall appearance

ðŸªµ After:
Installed brand-new, pressure-treated privacy fencing with a clean vertical picket finish
Reinforced posts for long-term durability and resistance to wind and weather
Uniform height and consistent alignment improved the look and value of the yard
Full perimeter restored for better security and peace of mind

A refreshed fence is more than just woodâ€”itâ€™s a fresh start for the backyard. This upgrade gave the homeowner the freedom to enjoy their outdoor space again, with style and privacy they can rely on.
