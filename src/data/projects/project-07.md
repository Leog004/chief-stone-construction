This project involved a full tear-off and reinstallation of a residential roofing system using GAF HDZ shingles and upgraded synthetic underlayment. The result is a clean, durable, and weather-resistant roof that enhances the property's value, efficiency, and longevity.

Scope of Work

Full removal of existing roof shingles and underlayment
Inspection and repair of roof decking as needed
Installation of synthetic underlayment for superior water resistance
Application of architectural shingles (GAF Timberline HDZ series)
Installation of new complete gutter system around the entire house
Installation of new french drain/gutter drain system to mitigate water run-off and water damage to the yard
Thorough cleanup and final inspection

Purpose & Impact

Protected the home with a fully weather-sealed roof system
Boosted curb appeal with uniform, modern shingle and gutter finish
Increased home value and longevity with a premium-grade roof, surrounding gutters, and water redirection system
Provided peace of mind with manufacturer warranty-backed materials

A roof and its gutters are more than protection—it's an investment in your home’s future. This complete roofing and gutter upgrade delivers lasting performance, safety, and visual appeal. With industry-leading materials and careful installation, the homeowners can rest easy knowing their property is protected for years to come.
