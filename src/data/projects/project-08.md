Added wood-paneled ceilings and wall cladding for warmth and character
Painted and trimmed for a cohesive, high-end finish

üîß Materials & Build Details

Engineered hardwood flooring in custom herringbone layout
Pressure-treated framing lumber for long-term stability
Spray foam and batt insulation for energy efficiency and comfort
Custom-milled pine and cedar planks for wall and ceiling accents
Mold-resistant drywall and modern matte paint finishes
