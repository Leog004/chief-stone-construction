This project was transformed and taken down to the bones. Adding insulation, new electrical, intricate flooring systems and patterns, and custom ceiling work — every detail was reimagined to create a refined and modern living environment with timeless craftsmanship.

Scope of Work

Framed new vaulted ceiling structure with exposed beam design
Installed full batt insulation for wall and ceiling cavities
Routed and installed all new necessary MEPs (mechanical, electrical, plumbing)
Applied new drywall, taped, floated, and textured throughout
Installed custom herringbone wood flooring for elevated visual impact
Added new loft area for a fun hideout to relax and replenish in a controlled system from the ground and in the loft 
Painted and trimmed for a cohesive, high-end finish

Purpose & Impact

Brought life to a old hot tub/storage space with a complete interior build-out
Increased home value with design-forward elements and quality craftsmanship
Created a visually cohesive, energy-efficient living environment
Delivered comfort, warmth, and a “custom home” feel through thoughtful finishes

This wasn’t just a renovation — it was a transformation. From exposed framing to fine detail, the space now reflects both form and function and the homeowners now enjoy a space that feels brand new, yet entirely their own.
