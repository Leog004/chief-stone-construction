This project brought new life to a historic home, combining interior and exterior remodeling with fresh landscaping for a fully transformed living experience. Every element—from curb appeal to indoor flow—was carefully reimagined to blend charm, functionality, and modern comfort.

Exterior Renovations

Repainted trim for a clean, bright finish to enhance curb appeal
Restored window trim and front door with modern contrast and detailing
Added mulch beds, trimmed existing trees, and cleaned up overgrowth for a refreshed, welcoming yard
Balanced privacy and openness using new, upgraded fencing.

Interior Renovations

Retextured and painted the entirety of the house and the wood trim and windows to bring a bright and more modern look while keeping the elegance of the origional historic trim. 
Renewed Hardwood floors throughout all 3 floors including the two staircases. With modern LVP in the sunroom, kitchen, and back entry.  
New light fixtures, vanities, and new window screens in all 42 windows. 
Updated kitchen with new built in pantry, cabinet doors, counterops, sink,and appliances. 

This project is a true example of what we love at Chief Stone Constructions: combining character and craftsmanship with modern comfort and smart planning. A house refreshed from the inside out—built to be loved for years to come.
