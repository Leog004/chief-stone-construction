1. Intro: What is the Virtual DOM?

“The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory copy of the real DOM.
It’s just a JavaScript object tree that represents what the UI should look like.
Example:
<h1>Hello</h1> → becomes { type: "h1", props: { children: "Hello" } }.”

2. Why Do We Need It?

“Updating the real DOM directly is slow:

It can trigger reflows and repaints.

It’s expensive if done too often.
React solves this by:

Doing all updates in the Virtual DOM first (cheap, in memory).

Then applying only the necessary changes to the real DOM.”

3. How It Works (3 Steps)

Initial Render

React builds a Virtual DOM tree from your JSX.

It uses that to create the real DOM once.

Updates

When state/props change, React builds a new Virtual DOM tree.

It compares (diffs) it with the old tree.

Commit (Patch)

React finds the minimal differences.

Updates only those parts in the real DOM.

Example: if only text changed, it just updates the text node.

4. Example
function Counter({ n }) {
  return <h1 className={n % 2 ? "odd" : "even"}>{n}</h1>;
}


Old Virtual DOM:
{ type: "h1", props: { className: "even", children: "0" } }

New Virtual DOM:
{ type: "h1", props: { className: "odd", children: "1" } }

React patches:

el.className = "odd"

textNode.nodeValue = "1"

5. Why It’s Powerful

“The Virtual DOM makes React:

Efficient → minimal DOM updates.

Declarative → I just describe the UI, React figures out how to update it.

Consistent → React batches and optimizes updates, so I don’t need to write manual DOM code.”

6. Analogy (non-technical)

“Think of the Virtual DOM as a blueprint.
You don’t knock down the house to add a window — you update the blueprint, figure out only what needs to change, and then build just that part. React does the same with the Virtual DOM.”




1. Intro: What is JSX?

“JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
It’s a syntax extension that lets us write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript.
Example:

const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;


It looks like HTML, but it’s really JavaScript.”

2. Why Do We Use It?

“JSX makes our UI code:

Readable → we describe components in a way that looks like the actual UI.

Powerful → we can mix HTML with JavaScript expressions.
Example:

const name = "Leo";
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;


Without JSX, the same thing would be:

const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, ", name);


JSX is just a cleaner way to write this.”

3. How Does JSX Work?

You write JSX → <h1>Hello</h1>

Babel compiles it into → React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello")

React builds a Virtual DOM object → { type: "h1", props: { children: "Hello" } }

React eventually renders it to the real DOM.

4. Features of JSX

Embedding expressions:

<p>{2 + 2}</p>  // Renders: <p>4</p>


Props look like attributes:

<img src="logo.png" alt="Logo" />


Children:

<div>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>World</p>
</div>


Components:

<Welcome name="Leo" />

5. Why It’s Powerful

“JSX combines the best of both worlds:

The declarative look of HTML.

The full power of JavaScript (expressions, variables, functions).
That’s why React apps often feel more intuitive to write.”

6. Analogy (non-technical)

“Think of JSX like a recipe card:

HTML is like a finished dish.

JavaScript is the raw ingredients.

JSX is the recipe format that lets me mix ingredients and describe the dish at the same time.”

✅ That gives you a ~5-minute JSX explainer:
What it is → Why → How it works → Features → Why powerful → Analogy.

Do you want me to also make a side-by-side slide idea (Left: JSX code, Right: what Babel compiles it into) so you can visually show people how JSX isn’t magic?
